# 🏥 Patient History Analyzer (RAG-Powered)

## 📚 Overview

The Patient History Analyzer is an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help healthcare professionals quickly understand a patient's medical history. By integrating multiple worker agents and leveraging LLMs (Groq API), this system retrieves, analyzes, and presents patient medical data in a concise and actionable summary.

This tool streamlines the diagnostic process, improves decision-making efficiency, and provides doctors with relevant insights from scattered medical records.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Doctors often need to quickly understand a patient's medical history to make informed decisions. However, medical histories can be lengthy, complex, and scattered across multiple sources, making it time-consuming to extract relevant insights.

---

## 💡 Solution

The **Patient History Analyzer** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that streamlines the process of summarizing patient history. It leverages vector databases and LLMs to retrieve, analyze, and present patient history in a concise, readable format for healthcare professionals.

## 🚀 Key Features

RAG-based Retrieval: Retrieves structured and unstructured patient data from multiple sources.

Natural Language Query: Accepts user input in plain text and answers questions about the patient's medical history.

Multi-Agent Collaboration: Utilizes multiple specialized agents:

 - Retriever Agent: Gathers patient data from EHR and medical records.

 - Validator Agent: Validates data integrity.

 - Analyzer Agent: Identifies patterns, trends, and risks.

 - Contextualizer Agent: Adds clinical context based on guidelines.

 - Decision Support Agent: Suggests next steps for doctors.

 - Presenter Agent: Summarizes the final report in a readable format.

LLM-Powered Summary: Generates precise AI-enhanced summaries using Groq API.

Fast and Efficient: Optimized with sentence transformers (device support: MPS, CUDA) and ChromaDB for rapid vector similarity search.

Console-based Visualization: Uses Rich library for visually appealing outputs.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Jupyter Notebook (Optional)
- Virtual Environment (Recommended)

---

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: User provides Patient ID and query.
2. **Retrieval**: Patient data is fetched and embedded.
3. **Vector Search**: Relevant chunks are retrieved from ChromaDB.
4. **Validation**: Missing or erroneous data is flagged.
5. **Analysis**: Retrieved chunks are analyzed based on the query.
6. **Contextualization**: Insights are enriched with clinical context.
7. **Decision Support**: Suggestions are made for the next steps.
8. **LLM Summary**: Concise summary is generated via DeepSeek LLM.
9. **Output**: Summary is displayed to the user.

## 🖥️ Sample Query & Output

``` Example Query: 
    Doctor: What are the patient’s chronic conditions?
```

``` Example Output:
    **Patient History Summary:**
    - Chronic Conditions: Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia

    **Contextualized Insights:**
    Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia require lifestyle modification and medication adherence.

    **Suggested Next Steps:**
    1. Review current medication adherence.
    2. Schedule blood pressure monitoring.   
```     

---

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate Real-Time EHR APIs
- Implement Caching Mechanism for Faster Retrieval
- Expand Contextualization with Medical Knowledge Graphs
- Support for Multi-Modal Data (e.g., Images, PDFs)
